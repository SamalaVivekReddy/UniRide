# UniRide - a Campus-Ride-Sharing-Platform
### Problem Statement:
As rideshare applications become more prevalent, they are gradually replacing traditional public transportation options. However, these platforms often overlook the unique needs of college students seeking long-distance transportation. Currently, students rely on unmoderated university Facebook pages to arrange rideshares, which is inefficient and cumbersome. The lack of a dedicated platform results in several issues: users spend excessive time searching for relevant rides, there is no standard format for creating or viewing posts, and irrelevant content clutters the feed. This disorganized approach makes it difficult for students to find or post rides effectively.

### Objective:
Our project aims to develop a mobile application, Uniride, specifically designed to meet the rideshare needs of college students. The platform will offer a unified and user-friendly interface, allowing students to create, view, and filter posts easily. By streamlining the process, Uniride will significantly reduce the time and effort required to find or arrange rides, making it a go-to solution for long-distance transportation on college campuses.

### Future:
Looking ahead, we plan to integrate a messaging system within the app, enabling users to communicate directly and arrange rides more efficiently. Additionally, a rating system will be introduced to enhance user trust and accountability, allowing both drivers and riders to evaluate each other. This feature will encourage better behavior and reliability on the platform.

Ultimately, we aim to implement a map view feature, which will allow users to search for and visualize rides based on specific destinations. Although we initially considered this feature too cluttered for our application, it will prove invaluable when combined with an advanced search function, making Uniride a comprehensive solution for long-distance ridesharing.
